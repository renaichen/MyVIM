# MyVIM

The oldest customization I made was manually adding plugin of *VIM-Latex* suite, which is quite inefficient, 
which should have been done by **Vundle**. But anyhow, I just didn't delete it and reinstall everything...
Just to make in mind, all the other plugins are managed by **Vundle**, and are stored under *Bundle* subdirectory.

The other configs in *.vimrc* are "Python-centric" mainly, not so many plugins either. 
Later on, more features may be added to it when getting more familiar.
One principle here is: **DO NOT add stuff you don't know what it does**.
